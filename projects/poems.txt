Life will find a way

Listen to what your future tells you 
Don’t let it go away 
Listen to what your past has to say 
Life will find a way

Listen to the chimes the wind brings to you 
Dried tears, barren hearts
You sit in your room, the world at a glance 
As the new beginning pulls your being apart

Listen to the strings being plucked next door
Happy and smiling, free of all dearth 
A minute passes by as the broken clock says 
How time isn’t aware of its own worth 

Listen to the cars as they flash by 
As you struggle your way home alone through the rains 
The immediate silence that follows as they pass
Reminding you of nothing that remains 

Listen to people speak of glory 
Entailed by the charlatans of modern times 
You find yourself lost, and moved yet still 
Fulfilling those dreams, worth nothing more than a couple dimes.

Listen to your mind, as it pushes you each day 
To move fast, learn faster, in spite in vain 
Analyse everything around, build better and stronger
If only merit could do the dance once again 

And listen to your heart, as it keeps faith in you 
That one day, you will find the bliss that’ll stay
A cripple makes its way through the crowd
As Life will find a way. 

I’LL BE THERE FOR SURE

When the night seems dark
And you feel all alone
When no one cares to help
And on your fate, you mourn 
Close your eyes, and take my name
I'll be there for sure.

When hopes, all shattered
All dreams, gone,
When your will is broken
And nothing left to carry along,
Close your eyes, and take my name
I'll be there for sure

When you think, you can't take it anymore
And your heart feels cold as ice
When you think, that might be, your last breath
And the world makes you pay the price
Close your eyes, and just take my name
I'll be there for sure

This one will last, stronger than time
And all that's gone in the past, the pleasure has been mine
What's still left wrong,
Together, we'll make it right
Close your eyes, hold my hands, and take my name
Trust me, my love
I'll be there, for sure.

CRY TO BE FREE
Wake up everyday,
To find a new way,
A new way to look at things.
Those, which we cannot go without,
Those, which we can freely talk about,
And yet, stay away from them,
Because the happiness that follows,
Is too heavy, to not condemn.

Don't be afraid of taking a stride,
And on your way you'll meet your pride.
Don't be afraid of holding it close,
And keep it within, until it glows.
Don't be afraid, of falling for that pride,
Be afraid of what comes next,
As it'll be one big dream,
You'll see to rip your soul apart,
And be ready to face an unexpected tide.

The mirror will start cracking then,
And break along with that dream,
But that's how it works,
As every piece that falls will scream
'I couldn't prove it to you,
And the failure says it all,
But trust me, I'd never hurt anyone,
Unless life is itself a lie.'
Yes, I've always been last, yet also the best,
As your 'best' hello, and 'last' good bye?

I cannot thank you enough, you see,
For what we have shared,
Is why I have always cared,
Leaving was but a choice, you'll agree.
But that's the spot where I'd say
This restless mind, will cry to be free.


HOPE
It has begun, son.
It's in you, it's in me
It's everywhere.
It is surrounding your senses. 
The need, is to feel it
You know what you want, but,
You don't realize how important it is. 
Remember, nothing works unless you do.
Our destiny is what we think of it
Our fate is, what we make of what we have.
Don't let your past hinder you. 
Keep the good old memories and leave
behind, the days of suffering.
Learn from your future. 
Learn from your own self.
You are all set to go.
On your journey, you'll meet someone
better than you.
Praise their abilities, pay respect 
to their achievements.
Get inspired, get motivated
You can achieve it, only if
You think you CAN.
Determination, Dedication, Devotion 
will help you find the right path.
Concentrate all your focus on your task,
for random efforts result in nothing. 
You are incomplete. But you'll find 
your better half, awaiting your presence, 
in your way, only if you choose the right one.

THE INSOUCIANT MOON

For all that's left with it today,
Memories - those we made, those we shared.
It will treasure with them all,
So what if they were made to haunt,
Hurting us all, from the inside,
Day in, day out.

Indifferent to pain or pleasure,
This side of the moon is what they always see.
The other side has darker spots.
Holes, craters, rough patches,
Reminiscent of all that it's been through.

It showed up, only when the nights were darkest.
For your days were bright enough.
Little did you know, albeit invisible,
It kept revolving around you, day and night
Keeping an eye yet, of all emotions, shy.

It was also the reason behind those eclipses.
Infrequent, but glaring.
Those were times, you hated it the most,
For dimming your day.
It was doing its job, which it had avowed.
Hope you see through, for it'll happen again.

You have a billion stars.
A billion watchful eyes upon you,
As you soar through the space.
Never forget, that they're far, far away,
The closest to you is your own light.

Too good to be true, a story to narrate,
The story is but a part of you.
And so is this grateful sphere.
Revolving around you,
As it has, as it will,
The insouciant moon.

LOOK MA

Look Ma, I’m grown up
I can talk to the world on my own
Think of us, of myself
Of all the good things we deserve ahead
I will set you free
Of all your burdens and daily chores
You’ll finally have a lot of time
To go and see your relatives
And not worry about the shops Papa toils in
Not worry about the pile of utensils
After preparing food for a dozen
Thrice a day.
Your health will get better ahead
As we’ll finally have enough juice
Which you made for us every morning
And lied saying you’ve had your share already
And you’ll see Papa stay home and rest
For his knees have started belying his faith
I will set him free
Of his mundane and strenuous job
That paid for all our childish demands
Worrying about who will look after his work
As he strolls through the lanes to collect the cheques
He will finally have time for charity
For someone who put faith in him years ago
That faith now needs to be passed on
My dream of seeing you both sit relaxed
On a Sunday afternoon, in our new home
Watching a new generation take my place
Giving you another chance
Giving you the parenthood you always wished for
I will take care of it all from here
May God give me enough strength
To not cry in a corner while I miss your caressing
You’ve raised me strong, but this weakness shall be involuntary.
What our future beholds may not be known
But I promise, Ma
I will be the son you’ve always deserved.

Look Ma, I’ve grown up.
