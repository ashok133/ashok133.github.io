	            	Listen to what your future tells you 
					</br>Don’t let it go away 
					</br>Listen to what your past has to say 
					</br>Life will find a way
					</br>
					</br>Listen to the chimes the wind brings to you 
					</br>Dried tears, barren hearts
					</br>You sit in your room, the world at a glance 
					</br>As the new beginning pulls your being apart
					</br>
					</br>Listen to the strings being plucked next door
					</br>Happy and smiling, free of all dearth 
					</br>A minute passes by as the broken clock says 
					</br>How time isn’t aware of its own worth 
					</br>
					</br>Listen to the cars as they flash by 
					</br>As you struggle your way home alone through the rains 
					</br>The immediate silence that follows as they pass
					</br>Reminding you of nothing that remains 
					</br>
					</br>Listen to people speak of glory 
					</br>Entailed by the charlatans of modern times 
					</br>You find yourself lost, and moved yet still 
					</br>Fulfilling those dreams, worth nothing more than a couple dimes.
					</br>
					</br>Listen to your mind, as it pushes you each day 
					</br>To move fast, learn faster, in spite in vain 
					</br>Analyse everything around, build better and stronger
					</br>If only merit could do the dance once again 
					</br>
					</br>And listen to your heart, as it keeps faith in you 
					</br>That one day, you will find the bliss that’ll stay
					</br>A cripple makes its way through the crowd
					</br>As Life will find a way. 
					</br>

					</br>I'll be there for sure.
					</br>
					</br>When hopes, all shattered
					</br>All dreams, gone,
					</br>When your will is broken
					</br>And nothing left to carry along,
					</br>Close your eyes, and take my name
					</br>I'll be there for sure
					</br>
					</br>When you think, you can't take it anymore
					</br>And your heart feels cold as ice
					</br>When you think, that might be, your last breath
					</br>And the world makes you pay the price
					</br>Close your eyes, and just take my name
					</br>I'll be there for sure
					</br>
					</br>This one will last, stronger than time
					</br>And all that's gone in the past, the pleasure has been mine
					</br>What's still left wrong,
					</br>Together, we'll make it right
					</br>Close your eyes, hold my hands, and take my name
					</br>Trust me, my love
					</br>I'll be there, for sure.

	            	For all that's left with it today,
					</br>Memories - those we made, those we shared.
					</br>It will treasure with them all,
					</br>So what if they were made to haunt,
					</br>Hurting us all, from the inside,
					</br>Day in, day out.
					</br>
					</br>Indifferent to pain or pleasure,
					</br>This side of the moon is what they always see.
					</br>The other side has darker spots.
					</br>Holes, craters, rough patches,
					</br>Reminiscent of all that it's been through.
					</br>
					</br>It showed up, only when the nights were darkest.
					</br>For your days were bright enough.
					</br>Little did you know, albeit invisible,
					</br>It kept revolving around you, day and night
					</br>Keeping an eye yet, of all emotions, shy.
					</br>
					</br>It was also the reason behind those eclipses.
					</br>Infrequent, but glaring.
					</br>Those were times, you hated it the most,
					</br>For dimming your day.
					</br>It was doing its job, which it had avowed.
					</br>Hope you see through, for it'll happen again.
					</br>
					</br>You have a billion stars.
					</br>A billion watchful eyes upon you,
					</br>As you soar through the space.
					</br>Never forget, that they're far, far away,
					</br>The closest to you is your own light.
					</br>
					</br>Too good to be true, a story to narrate,
					</br>The story is but a part of you.
					</br>And so is this grateful sphere.
					</br>Revolving around you,
					</br>As it has, as it will,
					</br>The insouciant moon.

            	<p>
            		Wake up everyday,
					</br>To find a new way,
					</br>A new way to look at things.
					</br>Those, which we cannot go without,
					</br>Those, which we can freely talk about,
					</br>And yet, stay away from them,
					</br>Because the happiness that follows,
					</br>Is too heavy, to not condemn.
					</br>
					</br>Don't be afraid of taking a stride,
					</br>And on your way you'll meet your pride.
					</br>Don't be afraid of holding it close,
					</br>And keep it within, until it glows.
					</br>Don't be afraid, of falling for that pride,
					</br>Be afraid of what comes next,
					</br>As it'll be one big dream,
					</br>You'll see to rip your soul apart,
					</br>And be ready to face an unexpected tide.
					</br>
					</br>The mirror will start cracking then,
					</br>And break along with that dream,
					</br>But that's how it works,
					</br>As every piece that falls will scream
					</br>'I couldn't prove it to you,
					</br>And the failure says it all,
					</br>But trust me, I'd never hurt anyone,
					</br>Unless life is itself a lie.'
					</br>Yes, I've always been last, yet also the best,
					</br>As your 'best' hello, and 'last' good bye?
					</br>
					</br>I cannot thank you enough, you see,
					</br>For what we have shared,
					</br>Is why I have always cared,
					</br>Leaving was but a choice, you'll agree.
					</br>But that's the spot where I'd say
					</br>This restless mind, will cry to be free.
